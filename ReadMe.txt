Android_VR_Game_Prototype
-------------------------

An Android VR game prototype developed during a BCIT project practicum term.
Our client at the time as a fellow instructor at BCIT who wanted use to develop
an android VR game Android VR game prototype.

The idea behind the prototype was to create a first person game from the
perspective of a person flying through a cave via a wing suit or a jet pack.
The cave is filled with obstacles (stalactites, stalagmites and columns) that
the player would have to avoid. In addition, the player can use special items
that slow the player down or speed the player up when consumed. To consume the
item the player must simply collide with it.

Written in C# using Unity 3D.
